🧠 Product Mix Optimization using Linear Programming
This project demonstrates how to solve a business problem — optimizing a product mix — using Linear Programming (LP) with the help of Python and the PuLP library.

📊 Problem Statement
Businesses often face constraints like limited resources (labor, materials, time) while aiming to maximize profits. This project formulates such a scenario as a Linear Programming problem to determine the optimal quantity of products to manufacture.

📁 Project Structure
✅ Features
LP model formulation using real-world business constraints
Solution using PuLP solver
Clear visualization of optimal product mix
Business insights derived from the solution
🔧 Tech Stack
Python 3.x
PuLP
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if included)
📌 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Product_Mix_Optimization.git
cd Product_Mix_Optimization
📈 Sample Output
✅ Optimal Product Mix:

Product A: 20 units

Product B: 30 units

💰 Maximum Profit Achieved: ₹12,500

💡 Insights
Demonstrates how resource allocation decisions impact profitability.

Can be extended to more complex supply chain or portfolio optimization problems.
